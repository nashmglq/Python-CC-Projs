#Python Data Structure for a JavaScript Developer. 

#List is an Array in Javascript here is an example
# To access list use my_list[index]
my_list = ["nash", "maglaqui", "steven"]


my_dict = {"name": "Nash", "age": 20}
# To access dict value use my_dict["name"]


#To summarize, in list we use index or position
# In dict we use keys

#JavaScript does not have any tupples or list but with ()
my_tupples = ("Wow", "Lol", "Lmao")


#Javascript has Object, Python has Dict or Dictionaries


# This is a obj (dict) with no values
my_list = {"one", "two", "three", "pikit hehe"}

print("This is from a list ", type(my_list), my_list)
print("This is from a tupple ",type(my_tupples), my_tupples)
print("This is from my dictionaries ", type(my_dict) , my_dict)
print("This is from my list", type(my_list), my_list)
